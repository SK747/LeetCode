        ## so we want to output a list of lists
        ## So first of all, the easy way is to obviously sort these...
        ## But then we want to return a list of lists, how are we going to do that?
        ## So this solution would work perfectly if leetcode would allow you to use lists as keys
        ## sorted is n log n so not good
