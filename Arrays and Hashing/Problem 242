## SOLUTION
## Its easy to do this just by using two for loops but thats O(n^2) complexity so lets avoid that
## Using a hash map is the better solution

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        ## if not same length, immeditely not an anagram
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        
        countS, countT = {},{} ## Use dictionaries to basically store each letter and how many times its been used
        for i in range(len(s)):
            countS[s[i]] = 1 + countS.get(s[i],0) ## THE GET IS FOR THE CASE THAT CountS is NOT INTIIALIZED
            countS[s[i]] = 1 + countS.get(s[i],0)
        for j in countS:
            if countS[j] != countT[j]:
                return False
        return True

            




s = Solution()
